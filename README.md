Q 1) Print the product of two matrices which is given.
A = [[1,2,3], # Matrix A
 [4,5,6], 
 [7,8,9]]
B = [[9,8,7], # Matrix B
 [6,5,4],
 [3,2,1]]
C = [[0, 0, 0], # Result Matrix
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]
 
Q2: Proportional Sampling - Select a number randomly with probability proportional to its 
magnitude from the given array of n elements.

Q3: Replace the digits in the string with '#'
test_str = '234, a2b3c4, abc, #2a$#b%c%561#'

Q4: Task is to print the name of students
a) Who got top 5 ranks, in the descending order of marks.
b) Who got least 5 ranks, in the increasing order of marks.
c) Who got marks between >25th percentile <75th percentile, in the increasing order of marks.
Students=['student1','student2','student3','student4','student5','student6','student7','student8','student9','student10'] 
Marks = [45, 78, 12, 14, 48, 43, 47, 98, 22, 80]

Q5: Find 5 closest points(based on cosine distance) in S from P
S= [(1,2),(3,4),(-1,1),(6,-7),(0, 6),(-5,-8),(-1,-1),(6,0),(1,-1)]
P= (3,-4).

Q6: Find Which line separates oranges and apples
Task is for each line that is given print "YES"/"NO", you will print yes, if all the red points are one
side of the line and blue points are other side of the line, otherwise no.

Q7: Filling the missing values in the specified formate.
string =[
 "_,_,_,24",
 "40,_,_,_,60",
 "80,_,_,_,_",
 "_,_,30,_,_,_,50,_,_"]
 
 Q8: Task is to find
a. Probability of P(F=F1|S==S1), P(F=F1|S==S2), P(F=F1|S==S3)
b. Probability of P(F=F2|S==S1), P(F=F2|S==S2), P(F=F2|S==S3)
c. Probability of P(F=F3|S==S1), P(F=F3|S==S2), P(F=F3|S==S3)
d. Probability of P(F=F4|S==S1), P(F=F4|S==S2), P(F=F4|S==S3)
e. Probability of P(F=F5|S==S1), P(F=F5|S==S2), P(F=F5|S==S3)

Q9: Given two sentances S1, S2 , task is to find
a. Number of common words between S1, S2
b. Words in S1 but not in S2
c. Words in S2 but not in S1
S1= "the first column F will contain only 5 uniques values"
S2= "the second column S will contain only 3 uniques values"

Q10. You will be given a list of lists, each sublist will be of length 2 i.e. [[x,y],[p,q],[l,m]..[r,s]] 
consider its like a martrix of n rows and two columns
a. the first column Y will contain interger values
b. the second column Ys c o r e will be having float values Your task is to find the value of
f (Y ,Ys c or e)=−
1∗1
n
Σf o r e ac hY , Ys c or e pa ir (Y l o g 10( Ys c or e )+(1−Y )l o g10 (1−Ys c o r e )) here n is the 
number of rows in the matrix Ex: [[1, 0.4], [0, 0.5], [0, 0.9], [0, 0.3], [0, 0.6], [1, 0.1], [1, 0.9], 
[1, 0.8]] output: 0.4243099
